""" Python is a object orientated programming language
 The term object stems from the fact that the model resembles objects in the real world each object is a thing, that has certain attributes and characteristics that make it unique

 i.e Car

Attributes : ( Years, Make, Model, Color)
Method (things they can do) : (Go, Stop, Turn)

class Car (think of it as a factory that creates all cars)

After a car is created it is an independent object. Changing one car has no effect on the other cars or the Car class.

***below is an instance*** of a class ***is an independent object with which you cna work

Attributes:     Methods:     
.year           .go()     
.make           .stop()     
.model          .turn()     
.color          .heat()     
.doors          .park()

"""
»» Class: A piece of code from which you can generate a unique object, where
each object is a single instance of the class. Think of a class as a blueprint or
factory from which you can create individual objects.

»» Instance: One unit of data plus code generated from a class as an instance
of that class. Each instance of a class is also called an object, just as all the
different cars are objects, all created by some car factory (class).

»» Attribute: A characteristic of an object that contains information about the
object. Also called a property of the object. An attribute name is preceded by a
dot, as in member.user_name, which may contain the user name for one club
member.

»» Method: A Python function associated with the class. A method defines an
action that an object can perform. You call a method by preceding the method
name with a dot and following it with a pair of parentheses. For example
member.archive() might be a method that archives (deactivates) the
member’s membership.
